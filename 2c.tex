\subsection*{c) Improvement of a}
Now we want to improve the a) by iterating over the solution:\\
With $A x = b$ we found imperfect $x' \approx x + \delta x$.
\begin{align}
    Ax' &= A\q{x+ \delta x} = b + \delta b\\
    A \delta x &= L U \delta x =  \delta b = Ax' - b \quad | \, \text{solve for} \, \delta x\\
    x '' &= x ' - \delta x
\end{align}
Once with only one iteration:

    \label{fig:err}
\end{figure}
What we see here in \ref{fig:err} is that the overall evolution of the error is the same for the LU decompositions and the iterations over the result: With higher x a higher error. The error for neville's algorithm is nearly constant. For the first and the last datapoint (the edges) neville's interpolation has no difference to the original data. This is a property of this algorithm.
